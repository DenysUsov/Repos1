# Repos1
This is a Python coding project made in Jupyter Notebook (the file NIR_PY.ipynb).
The purpose of the project is to analyze NIR (Near-Infrared) spectra stored in the milk.csv file which is a comma separated text file.

The original code was taken from https://nirpyresearch.com/classification-nir-spectra-principal-component-analysis-python/ and extended by
Dr. Denys Usov who is the creator of this depository.
